# ðŸ”¢ C++ Logical Pattern Programs

Welcome to my repository of **C++ logical pattern programs**!  
These patterns are purely based on numbers, characters, or a combination â€” no space formatting involved (i.e., not star triangles or pyramids).

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Inside?

- Logical patterns using numbers (`1`, `2`, ...)
- Patterns using characters (`A`, `B`, ...)
- Mixed patterns (`1 A 1 B 1`, etc.)
- Built using **pure logic** (no predefined strings)

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Repo?

This collection is part of my C++ learning journey.  
Each pattern here is carefully written using pure logic (no hardcoded strings or spacing).  
Ideal for beginners practicing logic building and pattern design.
