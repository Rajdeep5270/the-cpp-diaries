## ðŸ“Œ About

Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures in programming.
Mastering them builds a strong foundation for logic building, algorithm design, and problem-solving.

This repository includes:

ðŸ”¹ 1-D Array Programs â€“ Basic operations, searching, sorting, merging, reversing, etc.

ðŸ”¹ Multi-DImensional Array Programs â€“ Matrix operations, row/column sums, transposition, Filter For Negative Number, etc.

ðŸ”¹ Logic-Based Challenges â€“ Problems that test your analytical and coding skills.
