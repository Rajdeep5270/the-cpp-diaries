📌 Data Structures & Algorithms Menu-Driven Program (C++)

This project is a simple menu-driven C++ program that demonstrates essential Data Structures and Algorithms using easy, student-friendly code.
It includes a Linked List (using class), Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Binary Search — all accessible through a clear console menu.

🚀 Features
✅ Linked List (Using Class)

1. Insert a node
2. Display all nodes
3. Search for a value
4. Delete a node

✅ Sorting Algorithms

1. Merge Sort
2. Quick Sort

✅ Searching Algorithm

1. Binary Search (on sorted array)

✅ Menu-Driven Program

A simple interactive menu allows users to choose operations easily.

📁 Project Folder
 ├── main.cpp         // Contains menu + calling functions
 ├── Final.cpp        // Contains LinkedList class + sorting + searching code
 └── README.md        // Documentation

📘 How It Works

1. The program starts with a menu that displays all available operations.
2. You can insert, search, delete, or display nodes in the linked list.
3. You can perform Merge Sort or Quick Sort on a user-given array.
4. You can run Binary Search on a sorted array.
5. The program keeps running until you choose the Exit option.
