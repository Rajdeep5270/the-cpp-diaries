# 🔗 Dynamic Data Allocation (Linked List CRUD Operations)

This project demonstrates **Linked List CRUD operations** using **C++** — covering insertion, deletion, searching, reversing, and traversal of nodes with a clean console-based menu system.

## 🧠 Concept

This program is built using the concept of **Dynamic Data Allocation (DDA)**, where memory for nodes is dynamically created and linked.  
It showcases **Linked List fundamentals** such as:

- Dynamic memory creation (`new` / `delete`)
- Node linking and traversal
- Insertion and deletion operations
- Reversing the list order
- Counting and searching elements

---

## ⚙️ Features

✅ Insert node at **beginning**  
✅ Insert node at **end**  
✅ **Search** for any element  
✅ **Delete** node by value  
✅ **Reverse** the linked list  
✅ **Display** all nodes  
✅ Show **number of elements**  
✅ Graceful **exit and validation messages**

## 🧩 Code Structure

📂 Dynamic Data Allocation
┣ 📜 main.cpp → Handles user menu and interactions
┣ 📜 DDA.cpp → Contains DDA class with Linked List logic
┗ 📜 README.md → Project documentation (this file)

## 📜 Menu Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Insert element from beginning |
| 2 | Insert element from end |
| 3 | Search element |
| 4 | Delete element by value |
| 5 | Reverse linked list |
| 6 | Display all elements |
| 7 | Count number of elements |
| 0 | Exit program |

---

## 🧾 Sample Output

1. Insert From Starting
2. Insert From Ending
3. Search Element
4. Delete Element
5. Reverse all Elements
6. Display all Nodes
7. Number of Elements
0. Exit
Enter Your Choice : 1

ADD ELEMENT AT STARTING

Enter Element : 10
Press Enter to Continue...!

## 🧮 Example Operations

| Operation | Description | Result |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| Insert 10, 20, 30 | Adds 3 elements | 10 → 20 → 30 |
| Search 20 | Found | ✅ |
| Delete 10 | Removes first element | 20 → 30 |
| Reverse | Reverses order | 30 → 20 |
| Count | Shows total nodes | 2 |

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++  
- **Concept:** Dynamic Data Structures  
- **Memory Management:** `new` and `delete` operators  
- **Style:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
